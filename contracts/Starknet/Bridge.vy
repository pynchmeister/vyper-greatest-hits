@title Starknet ERC-20 Bridge, adapted from official Starknet documentation
	   [https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/l1l2.html]
     @notice You can use this contract to deposit and withdraw an ERC-20 to and from
		Starknet.
@dev After the token is deposited in Starknet, there are currently no functions to
	 deal with them on Starknet itself. You can only withdraw back to L1 and view
	 the balance on Starknet.
